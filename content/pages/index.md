          We will take your canine buddy on 15-30 minute walk or 30-60 minute
          walk (you chose)  so your dog will come back happy from breathing
          fresh air and running around. No job is too big or small!

          it would be nice if you could provide us with poop bags, leash, and
          treats so we can take care of your cute dog. Also please make sure
          that your dog is not aggresive to other people. Thank you!
